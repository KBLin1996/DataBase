1. Open mysql: (1) mysql --user=root --password (2) Enter password

2. Create a database: CREATE DATABASE database_name;

3. Assign which database to use: USE database_name;

4. Look up all the databases: show databases

5. Create a table and define all the variables: CREATE TABLE table_name( sid INTEGER, sname CHAR(30), rating INTEGER, age DECIMAL(4,1) NULL, PRIMARY KEY(sid));

age DECIMAL(4,1) NULL -> means that age is a 4-digits float number with and exact value to the first decimal place

6. Import a .csv file and encode it with 'big-5': LOAD DATA INFILE 'Hw1.csv'  INTO TABLE table_name CHARACTER SET big5  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','  ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' IGNORE 1 ROWS;

7. Print all the contents in the table: SELECT * FROM table_name;

8. Delete table: DROP TABLE table_name;

9. Delete database: DROP DATABASE database_name;

10. Restart mysql: service mysql restart;

11. Quit mysql: \q


**Note: In order to load a .csv file into your own database, it is essential to put your .csv file under /var/lib/mysql/database_name/
